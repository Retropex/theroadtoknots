# Electrum X

<Callout emoji="&#x2139;">
	Time: 15 minutes and 7 days waiting for synchronization/indexing
</Callout>

Using Electrum X, you can use the [Electrum protocol](https://electrumx-spesmilo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocol-basics.html). This protocol lets wallets and other software communicate with nodes. In other places in the guide, you can connect tools and wallets that communicate via the Electrum protocol directly to your node. A functionality that promotes privacy. For example, you can also connect the [BTC RPC Explorer](/bitcoin-knots-extensions/btc-rpc-explorer) to your own Electrum X server. Then when you look up information about your transactions or addresses from yourself in the future, no one will be able to see it. This way no one can link transactions to you and you enjoy more privacy.

It can take up to 7 days before Electrum X is fully indexed and usable. Until then you can't use it.

## Installation

Make sure you are in the home directory.

```bash
cd ~
```

Install the following packages on your Raspberry.

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip build-essential libc6-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libreadline-dev libleveldb-dev
```

Using `pip` you can install a Python-specific package needed for Electrum X.

```bash
sudo pip3 install plyvel
```

Clone the source code for Electrum X.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spesmilo/electrumx
```

Navigate the directory you just cloned into.

```bash
cd electrumx
```

Grab the latest version.

```bash
git checkout 1.16.0
```

Finally, install Electrum X.

```bash
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

## Configuration

As with all the other tools in this guide, you can configure Electrum X in some way. First, we provide a location where the database of Electrum X is stored. Then we create keys using `openssl`. Finally, we configure Electrum X using a configuration file.

Create an `.electrumx` folder in the home directory containing another `db` folder.

```bash
mkdir ~/.electrumx

mkdir ~/.electrumx/db
```

Enter the directory.

```bash
cd ~/.electrumx
```

Run the following three openssl commands to create a set of keys and certificates. During this process you will need to enter some information, but you will see that.

```bash
openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
openssl x509 -req -days 1825 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt
```

The final step of configuring involves creating the configuration file. Create a file.

```bash
nano ~/.electrumx/electrumx.conf
```

Put the following text in there.

```bash
NET=mainnet
COIN=Bitcoin
CACHE_MB=500
DB_ENGINE=leveldb
DB_DIRECTORY=/home/ubuntu/.electrumx/db
DAEMON_URL=http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@127.0.0.1
SSL_CERTFILE=/home/ubuntu/.electrumx/server.crt
SSL_KEYFILE=/home/ubuntu/.electrumx/server.key
SERVICES=tcp://:50001,ssl://:50002,wss://:50004,rpc://
```

Before you save it, you need to make two adjustments. In the `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` places, enter the username-password combination you created in the [authentication part of the Bitcoin Knots configuration](/bitcoin-knots/configure-and-start). Once everything is correct you can save the file with `Ctrl + X` and confirm with `Y`.

## Firewall and Router

In principle, you can connect a local tool such as [BTC RPC Explorer](/bitcoin-knots-extensions/btc-rpc-explorer) directly to Electrum X. There is no need to open any ports for this, as local connections are always allowed (i.e. from the Pi to the Pi). However, if you want to use Electrum X in an app like BlueWallet, you need to execute the following commands to open two ports.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 50001
sudo ufw allow 50002
```

If you want to use Electrum X as a backend from outside your network, then you need to throw the same ports open on your router and loop through to your Pi.

## Automation

Electrum X is something you always want to have running in the background. That's why we're going to automate startup through a service. Create a service.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/electrumx.service
```

Put the following text in there.

```toml
[Unit]
Description=Electrum X Server
Requires=bitcoind.service
After=network.target

[Service]
User=ubuntu
EnvironmentFile=/home/ubuntu/.electrumx/electrumx.conf
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/electrumx_server
Restart=always
TimeoutSec=120
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save it with `Ctrl + X` and confirm with `Y`.

Enable and start the service with these two commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable electrumx

sudo systemctl start electrumx
```

After about a minute of starting up, you can ask Electrum X for some information.

```bash
electrumx_rpc getinfo
```

If your output looks like the one below you are done!

```bash

    "coin": "bitcoin"

}
```

## Updating

Stop the Electrum X service.

```bash
sudo systemctl stop electrumx
```

Go to the application directory.

```bash
cd ~/electrumx
```

Update the repository with the latest changes via Git.

```bash
git fetch --all
```

Show the latest version/tag/release.

```bash
git describe --tags `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1`
```

Retrieve the changes from the latest release.

```bash
git checkout <OUTPUT FROM PREVIOUS STEP> # for example 1.16.0
```

Install the software.

```bash
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

Start the Electrum X service.

```bash
sudo systemctl start electrumx
```

Electrum X is now updated!
