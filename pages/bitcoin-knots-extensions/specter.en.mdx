[Specter](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop) was launched to make it easier to set up a multisig construction. It offers an easy to use tool which you can view in your browser. To keep this part of the guide somewhat simple, you must have physical access to your node to use Specter. To use Specter and set up a [multisig](https://youtu.be/yeLqe_gg2u0) you need to connect your hardware wallets to the Pi. A clear explanation of how to use Specter can be found at the bottom of the page. In this section, we'll cover how to install and open Specter.

SSH into your Pi and run the installation command for the necessary tools.

```bash
sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev python3-pip -y
```

Next, install Specter.

```bash
pip3 install cryptoadvance.specter
```

And finally, you start Specter with:

```bash
python3 -m cryptoadvance.specter server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 25441
```

The tool will now run in the background on port number `:25441`. Open your browser and go to `the ip of your pi:port number`. It will look something like: `192.168.1.6:25441`.

If you are using a firewall it is important that you open the corresponding port.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 25441 comment "Port for Specter"
```

## Automation

As with all the other tools in this guide, we will run Specter in the background. This way you don't have to manually start Specter every time before you can use it.

Create a service.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/specter.service
```

Paste the following into it.

```toml
[Unit]
Description=Specter
Requires=bitcoind.service
After=bitcoind.service
[Service]
ExecStart=python3 -m cryptoadvance.specter server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 25441
User=ubuntu
Group=ubuntu
Type=simple
Restart=on-failure
TimeoutSec=120
RestartSec=30
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save the file with `Ctrl + X` followed by `Y`.

Activate the service.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable specter
```

And start the service.

```bash
sudo systemctl start specter
```

Go to `http://PI-IP-ADDRESS:25441` to see if it works. For example `http://192.168.1.6:25441`.

## Updating

Every now and then a new version of Specter is released. Updating is pretty easy. First you throw the service off.

```bash
sudo systemctl stop specter
```

Updating is done as follows.

```bash
pip3 install cryptoadvance.specter --upgrade
```

Finally, you start the service again with the `systemctl` command.

```bash
sudo systemctl start specter
```

Once you go back to the Specter website as described earlier, you will see the version number at the bottom left.
