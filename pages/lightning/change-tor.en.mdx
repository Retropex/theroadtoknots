# Change tor

Tor needs a few modifications so that you can communicate with LND from the outside. This way you can connect a mobile wallet to your Lightning node and use it anywhere.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="&#x26A0;"> 
        Notice. As soon as someone gets hold of your macaroon files, your funds are no longer safe. You can also skip the Tor part and only use Lightning when you are on the same network as your node. Or use DDNS.

Open torrc:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
```

In the torrc file (we have [previously been here](/bitcoin-knots/change-tor)), add the following lines after what is already there.

```bash
SOCKSPort 9050

HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/lightning/rest
HiddenServiceVersion 3
HiddenServicePort 8080 127.0.0.1:8080

HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/lightning/rpc
HiddenServiceVersion 3
HiddenServicePort 10009 127.0.0.1:10009
```

Save the file with the key combination `Ctrl + X`. Enter `Y` in response to the prompt to save.

Create directories with:

```bash
sudo mkdir /var/lib/tor/lightning
```

```bash
sudo mkdir /var/lib/tor/lightning/rest
```

```bash
sudo mkdir /var/lib/tor/lightning/rpc
```

Give the appropriate permissions with:

```bash
sudo chown -R debian-tor:debian-tor /var/lib/tor/lightning/rest
```

```bash
sudo chown -R debian-tor:debian-tor /var/lib/tor/lightning/rpc
```

```bash
sudo chmod 700 /var/lib/tor/lightning/rest
```

```bash
sudo chmod 700 /var/lib/tor/lightning/rpc
```

Tor should now be restarted.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart tor
```

## Onion addresses

You get the onion addresses with:

```bash
sudo cat /var/lib/tor/lightning/rest/hostname
```

```bash
sudo cat /var/lib/tor/lightning/rpc/hostname
```
