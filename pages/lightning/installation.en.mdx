[Lighting Network Daemon](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd#lightning-network-daemon) is an implementation of the Lightning Network protocol. It is a second layer on Bitcoin, where bitcoind is the first layer. But if you want to install LND then you probably already knew that.

        Note that this section is dependent on the [Golang installation](/raspberry-pi/common-dependecies#golang). You can't proceed if you don't have Golang installed on the Raspberry Pi. And of course you need an installation of Bitcoin Knots first.

Make sure you are in the home directory.

```bash
cd ~ 
```

Get the source code in.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd
```

Enter the LND directory.

```bash
cd lnd
```

Switch to the latest release.

```bash
git checkout v0.17.0-beta
```

And install LND. The tags are useful to provide in advance if you want to use [Lightning Terminal](/lightning-extensions/lightning-terminal) and other tools later.

```bash
make install tags="autopilotrpc signrpc walletrpc chainrpc invoicesrpc routerrpc watchtowerrpc monitoring peersrpc"
```
