Now that Knots is running in the background, you'd probably want to see what it's doing. An empty screen doesn't see much though. For those kinds of things the bitcoin-cli exists. Using this you can fire off commands to bitcoind and get responses back. You can do everything through the CLI; from getting information about the Bitcoin network, until creating complex multi-signature constructions.

The most useful command which will get you information about everything that's possible, is "help".

```bash
bitcoin-cli help
```

For more information about the different commands you can go to websites like [Chainquery](https://chainquery.com/bitcoin-cli). The way the different commands work are explained in depth.

A few useful commands are listed below.

```bash
# To check out the current block height
bitcoin-cli getblockcount

# A short summary about the bitcoin network
bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo

# Blockchain statistics
bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo
```

Knots is changing continuously. So it could be possible that some of commands above won't work in the future or are named differently.
