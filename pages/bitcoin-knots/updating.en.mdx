# Updating

Before you get started, make sure your Pi is up-to-date with `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade -y`.

Go to the application directory.

```bash
cd ~/bitcoin
```

Update the repository with the latest changes via Git.

```bash
git fetch --all
```

Show the latest version/tag/release.

```bash
git describe --tags `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1`
```

Retrieve the changes from the latest release.

```bash
git checkout -f <OUTPUT OF PREVIOUS STEP> #example: v25.0
```

Be sure to start from a clean slate. It could prevent some errors later on.

```bash
make clean
```

Rebuild bitcoin Knots based on the version of the source code you just checked out. The addition of `-j $(nproc)` uses all the cores of the CPU and would make the build faster than it would be without this addition.

```bash
make -j $(nproc)
```

The build will finish in about an hour. Nice time for a beer or cup of coffee!

Stop services that depend on Bitcoin Knots, such as btc-rpc-explorer, LND or Electrum. You know best which ones you have running. From experience, not turning off services that depend on Knots doesn't really matter. The services will temporarily not receive data from during Knots update, after which it will resume once Knots is turned back on.

Stop the bitcoind service:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop bitcoind
```

Now install the software. This will take up to 5 minutes.

```bash
sudo make install
```

Start the service bitcoin. The service will have started fairly quickly but the blockchain may need to download a few more blocks depending on how long the service was stopped.

```bash
sudo systemctl start bitcoind
```

Check the current version of bitcoin Knots.

```bash
bitcoin-cli --version
```

The output will look like `Bitcoin Knots RPC client v25.0` and Knots is now updated!

Start the other services you may have disabled. Note that when you start LND, unlocking LND can only be done after bitcoin's blockchain has been resynchronized. Check with `tail -f -n 200 .bitcoin/debug.log` how far along it is. Services start this way:

```bash
sudo systemctl start bitcoind
```
